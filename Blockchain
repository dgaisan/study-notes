[Blockchain] 
decentralized digital ledger of transactions. Every transaction is stored as a block in the chain and linked to the previous block using cryptography. It’s like a database of transactions. There are public or private blockchains. When transaction is made it’s broadcast to a network of computers called Nodes. Blockchain is immutable (order of blocks), unless the 51% attack. 
Each block contains 
	- records/transactions (each transaction is signed by a private key of transaction owner), 
	- reference to previous block, 
	- a proof of work (or a different consensus, Proof of Stake for example). 
Transaction can be a financial transaction, an event, any any other piece of data


Blockchain is a specific type of distributed ledger that uses blocks to store transactions data

[Types of blockchains]
- Public (not under anyone’s ownership)
	- Bitcoin, Etherium
	- Anyone can join and participate (read, write)
	- transparent
	- encrypted
	- everyone is anonymous
	- Append only
	- Participation: provide a transaction (someone will verify a block for a fee); Participate in consensus (mining)
	- Normally larger than private blockchains, and also safer
	- transactions are slow, verifying takes times, (tsx is visible right away but doesn’t get included into main ledger until verified)

- Private
	- by invitation
	- much smaller than public ones
	- not anonymized
	- faster transactions (due to smaller number of participants)

- Semi private or hybrid
	- most of the time everyone can participate

- Sidechain
	- separate blockchain that connects to main blockchain
	- Polkadot

- Permissioned ledger
	- blockchain with permissions controls
	- Ripple (built on its own blockchain) 

- Tokenized blockchain
	- creates cryptocurrency thru initial offering/distribution or mining (reward) as an outcome of a process defined by consensus
	- validating someones transaction via Proof Of Work results into a fee/reward

- Tokenless blockchain
	- not really a blockchain because they lack the basic of transfer of value unit

[Address or bitcoin address]
	- unique identifiers that are unique identifiers.
	- comprised of 26-35 alphanumeric character
	- requires public key + private key 
	- apply sha256sum to public key = address

[Transaction]
	- main unit of blockchain
	- transferring of values from one address to another

[Transfer fee]
	- Miners get a fee for adding a transaction to a block
	
[Block]
	- block hash, timestamp, nonce and at least one transaction

[Block explorer]
	- a tool for viewing information about blocks

[Block height]
	- represents the number of blocks that are ahead of a given block

[P2P network]
	- type of network where each peer can contact  other peers  and exchange information

[Smart contract]
	- computer program that is used to set the rules of a contract between two parties
	- don’t require 3rd party
	- contracts auto execute
	- parties remain anonymous
	- transparent

[Oracles]
	- 3rd party information source
	- part of smart contract system
	- oracles deliver external data to smart contacts (by themself SC can’t access external info)
	- 

[Consensus]
	- An agreement between the parties (about the state of the blockchain)
	-  

[Confirmation]
	- happens when a network has successfully processed a transaction

[Cryptocurrency]
	- digital form of money
	- use blockchain for transferring
	- they are not blockchain
	- use decentralized control system (via distributed ledger)

[Cryptographic hash function]
	- mathematical function that takes an input value of some length and output another value of fixed length
	- MD5, SHA256, HMAC
	- Deterministic: For the same input there always be same output
	- Collision resistant
	- 

[DAPP]
	- Decentralized Application
	- backend runs on multiple computers that are part of decentralized	network
	- 

[DAO] 
	- Decentralized Autonomous Organization
	- software that runs on top of blockchain

[Distributed ledger]
	- network of identical databases
	- often confused with blockchain, but they are not
	- data saved on each node individually. When all participants reach agreement the ledger gets updated

[Digital signature]
	- used to identify an entity which is sending a message
	- 

[Ethirium]	
	- blockchain technology
	- programming language Solidity
	- smart contract technology: scripts can be put into transactions (and run as an event)
	- smaller blocks: 2KB
	
[EVM]
	- Eth virtual machine
	- network of machines that run the same software, and are public nodes
	
[Testnet]
	- software that is used for testing out new features and changes to the blockchain w/o disrupting the primary software
	- identical to the original blockchain being tested
	- Bitcoin and Eth use testnets
	- sorta dev env

[Fork]
	- creates a separate version of a chain
	- happens when underlying software is changed/updated but not all users agree on the new rules
	- in essence they are change to a cryptocurrency protocol 
	- Soft-Fork - backward compatible upgrade
	- hard-Fork - nodes that don’t upgrade to new software will no longer be able to validate transactions or mine blocks on new chain
